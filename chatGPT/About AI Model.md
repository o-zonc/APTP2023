# 1. Which method should I try to make an AI model that can yield high score in "Breakout" game?
To create an AI model that can achieve high scores in the classic "Breakout" game, you can use a reinforcement learning algorithm, such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or a variant of it.

The DQN algorithm uses a neural network to approximate the optimal action-value function, which is used to determine the best action to take in a given state. The algorithm learns by repeatedly playing the game and updating the network's parameters based on the rewards received for each action taken. Over time, the model will learn to take actions that maximize the score in the game.

One popular Python package that provides an implementation of the DQN algorithm is TensorFlow's Keras RL. Keras RL provides a high-level interface for implementing various reinforcement learning algorithms, including DQN, and can be used with popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras.

To train the model to play Breakout, you can use an emulator such as OpenAI Gym, which provides an environment for training and evaluating reinforcement learning models. You can use the Gym's Atari environment, which includes a version of the Breakout game, to train your model.

In summary, you can use the DQN algorithm with TensorFlow's Keras RL package and an emulator such as OpenAI Gym to create an AI model that can achieve high scores in the Breakout game.

# 2. Then, which Python module should I try to do that?
To implement a Deep Q-Network (DQN) or other reinforcement learning algorithms for playing Breakout game, you can use various Python modules such as:
